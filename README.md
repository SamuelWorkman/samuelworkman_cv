# Description

This repo contains my data-driven [pagedown package](https://pagedown.rbind.io) cv for my academic and consulting work. This repo is forked from [Nick Strayer's](https://www.github.com/nstrayer/cv) version of a [pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io) cv.

# To Do:
- [ ] Move Skills & Experience to text-block
- [ ] parse positions sheet
- [ ] create different sheet for two-page cv
- [x] Move references to separate file.
- [ ] Add language bar back.
